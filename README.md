This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, Check your node.js: go to Window->run->cmd-> npm -v. If you don't download yet, go to: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Second, open Chat App folder by VS code -> View -> Terminal

Third, install extension for chat app. Copy below to terminal to install:
```bash
npm install -D @types/bcrypt

npm install -D prisma

npm install next-auth@latest @prisma/client @next-auth/prisma-adapter bcrypt

npm install axios

npm install react-hot-toast

npm install react-icons react-hook-form clsx


```
Fourth, install extension in VS code:
```bash
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

PostCSS Language Support

Prisma

MongoDB for VS Code

Code Runner

Beautify css/sass/scss/less

```

Fifth, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev 
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
